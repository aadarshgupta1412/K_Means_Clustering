# K_Means_Clustering

AUTHOR : Aadarsh Gupta

# Introduction

Clustering or cluster analysis is a machine learning technique, which groups the unlabelled dataset. K-Means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster. The following is the implementation of K-Means Clustering algorithm to a given income dataset of 21 subjects consisting of age and income (resepective names are given, but not required for training).

# Packages Used
The following packages have been used while training of the model and visualization puposes :
- pandas : for data processing operations I/O in CSV file
- scikit-learn : to implement machine learning methods and pre-processing techniques
- matplotlib : for data visualization and graphical plotting
- seaborn : for data visualization for statistical graphics plotting
